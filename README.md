## Modern CI/CD Tools: Synergy in Action

Central to the prowess of the AWS EC2 Instance Checker is its seamless integration with today's top CI/CD tools. Let's unpack the role of each tool in this ensemble:

### 1. GitHub Actions: The Heartbeat of Workflow Automation

Think of streamlining your software workflows right within GitHub; that's what GitHub Actions achieves. For our application, any changes to the `main` branch beckon GitHub Actions. It then crafts a Docker image and sends it to DockerHub.

### 2. Argo CD & Argo CD Image Updater: The Choreographers of Kubernetes Deployment

Enter Argo CD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery gem designed for Kubernetes. It shoulders the responsibility of ensuring our application's desired state (as defined in a Git repository) aligns with the Kubernetes cluster's actual state. Pair this with Argo CD Image Updater, and you're looking at a formidable duo that deploys and keeps Kubernetes manifests synchronized with the latest Docker images.

### 3. Helm: The Maestro of Kubernetes Package Management

Helm, recognized as Kubernetes' package manager, simplifies the intricacies of deployment. Our application's Helm chart outlines the Kubernetes resources in detail, enabling Argo CD to manage and update the application deployment effortlessly.

## The Symphony of Deployment
^
Navigating through buzzwords like CI/CD, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, and Helm might feel overwhelming. But, we're here to demystify! Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: ArgoCD syncs the Helm deployment in Kubernetes, marking GitHub as the definitive source.
2. **Commit & Build**: A developer's commit in the Python code activates GitHub Actions, which in turn crafts a container and propels it to Docker Hub.
3. **Monitor & Update**: Argo CD Image Updater keeps an eye on GitHub. On detecting a new container version, it tweaks the Helm charts, leading to an updated Kubernetes deployment.

This loop ensures consistent synchronization, with GitHub established as the source of truth.

For the Architects: You now have a robust overview of the entire structure, the relationships between components, and the CI/CD flow. With this understanding, you can make informed decisions and strategies for application deployment and scaling. If you're mainly interested in the higher-level architecture and design, you may choose to conclude your reading here.

### Installing kubectl

For detailed information, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

1. **Prepare your system**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
    ```

2. **Set up the Kubernetes apt repository**:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /etc/apt/keyrings
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
    ```

3. **Install `kubectl`**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
    ```

### Adding a New Context to `kubeconfig` for kubectl

After successfully installing `kubectl`, if you're working with multiple Kubernetes clusters, you might need to set up different contexts to switch seamlessly between these clusters.

1. **Prerequisites**:

    Ensure you have `kubectl` installed by checking its version:
    ```bash
    kubectl version
    ```

2. **Set up a new context**:
   
    Assume you've obtained credentials for a new Kubernetes cluster. To configure a new context, you need specifics about the cluster, user, and possibly a namespace.

    Firstly, define the cluster:
    ```bash
    kubectl config set-cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> --server=<CLUSTER_ENDPOINT> --certificate-authority=<PATH_TO_CA>
    ```

    Next, provide user credentials:
    ```bash
    kubectl config set-credentials <USER_NAME> --client-key=<PATH_TO_CLIENT_KEY> --client-certificate=<PATH_TO_CLIENT_CERT>
    ```

    Finally, create the context using the defined cluster and user:
    ```bash
    kubectl config set-context <CONTEXT_NAME> --cluster=<CLUSTER_NAME> --user=<USER_NAME>
    ```

3. **Verify your new context**:

    To ensure your context is properly established, view it with:
    ```bash
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

    If your newly added context appears in the list, you can activate it using:
    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context <CONTEXT_NAME>
    ```

Remember, by establishing various contexts in your `kubeconfig`, you can efficiently manage and alternate between multiple Kubernetes clusters. Always keep your `kubeconfig` files in a secure location, as they hold crucial access details.

### Installing Helm

For detailed information, refer to the Helm's official guide [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

1. **Setup the Helm repository**:
    ```bash
    curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
    ```

2. **Install Helm**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install helm
    ```

---

### Installing ArgoCD CLI

For detailed information, check out the ArgoCD official documentation [here](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).

1. **Download and install latest ArgoCD version**:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL -o argocd-linux-amd64 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
    sudo install -m 555 argocd-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argocd
    rm argocd-linux-amd64
    ```

---

### Installing ArgoCD
For detailed information, refer to the ArgoCD's official guide [here](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).

1. **Create a new namespace for ArgoCD**:
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace argocd
    ```

2. **Install ArgoCD into the created namespace**:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
    ```

3. **Change the `argocd-server` service type to `LoadBalancer`**:
    ```bash
    kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
    ```

4. **Retrieve the initial admin secret**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets -n argocd argocd-initial-admin-secret -o yaml
    echo "<-secret-string->" | base64 -d
    ```

5. **Login to ArgoCD**:
   
   First, get the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `argocd-server`:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service -n argocd argocd-server
   ```
   
   Use the obtained IP or hostname to login:
   ```bash
   sudo argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER> --insecure
   ```

   The `--insecure` flag is used to disable server certificate validation. This is useful when connecting to an ArgoCD server that does not have a trusted certificate (e.g., self-signed). While it simplifies the login process, it's essential to understand that by skipping the certificate validation, you may be susceptible to "man-in-the-middle" attacks. In a production environment, you should aim to use a valid SSL/TLS certificate for ArgoCD to avoid using this flag.

6. **Verify the ArgoCD installation**:
    ```bash
    argocd version
    ```

    The output should resemble:
    ```
    argocd: v2.8.0+804d4b8
      BuildDate: 2023-08-07T19:41:16Z
      GitCommit: 804d4b8ca6bc4c2cf02c5c971aa923ec5b8623f0

### Setting up ArgoCD Image Updater
For detailed information, refer to the ArgoCD's Image Updater official guide [here](https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

1. **Install ArgoCD Image Updater**:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/stable/manifests/install.yaml
    ```

2. **Configure Logging Level for Troubleshooting**:
   
   Edit the `argocd-image-updater-config` ConfigMap to set the desired log level:
   ```yaml
   data:
     log.level: debug
   ```

3. **Verify the Logs**:
   
   After you've set up the Image Updater, you can inspect its logs to ensure everything's running correctly:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n argocd logs argocd-image-updater-<POD_NAME>
   ```

   Ideally, the logs should indicate no applications are using the Image Updater yet.

   ```bash
   time="2023-08-15T08:06:06Z" level=info msg="Processing results: applications=1 images_considered=0 images_skipped=0 images_updated=0 errors=0"
   ```

4. **Authorize Image Updater to Update GitHub Image Versions**:

   For this, you need to create a Kubernetes secret with your GitHub username and personal access token. You can create and manage personal access tokens in GitHub by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
   
   Store the GitHub credentials in environment variables:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_USER=<YOUR_USERNAME>
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
   ```

   Create the necessary secret in Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   kubectl --namespace argocd \
       create secret generic git-creds \
       --from-literal=username=$GITHUB_USER \
       --from-literal=password=$GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

5. **Define an Application using a Manifest**:

   Now, create the ArgoCD application referencing the GitHub credentials to utilize the ArgoCD Image Updater. Make sure the manifest aligns with your project's specifics:
   
   ```yaml
      apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Application
      metadata:
        name: aws-ec2-instance-checker
        namespace: argocd
        annotations:
          argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list: fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker:*
          argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/write-back-method: git:secret:argocd/git-creds
          argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/git-branch: master
      spec:
        project: default
        source:
          repoURL: https://github.com/fdervisi/k8s_cicd_overview
          targetRevision: HEAD
          path: helm/aws-ec2-instance-checker
        destination:
          server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          namespace: aws-ec2-instance-checker
        syncPolicy:
          automated:
            prune: true
            selfHeal: true
            allowEmpty: true
   ```

    After saving the manifest, apply it to Kubernetes:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f argocd-app.yaml
    ```

    This command will instruct Kubernetes to create the resources defined in the `argocd-app.yaml` file. If the Application already exists, it will be updated with the new specifications from the file.


6. **Validate the Configuration**:
   
   You can recheck the logs after setting up the application:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n argocd logs argocd-image-updater-<POD_NAME>
   ```

   After setting up an application, you should see logs indicating that the Image Updater is processing an application:

   ```bash
   time="2023-08-15T08:06:06Z" level=info msg="Processing results: applications=1 images_considered=1 images_skipped=0 images_updated=1 errors=0"
   ```

   And verify the application in argocd using:
   ```bash
   argocd app list
   ```

   After applying the manifest to Kubernetes and allowing ArgoCD a moment to synchronize, you can see the new application reflected in the ArgoCD GUI.

   And this is how it looks like in the ArgoCD graphical user interface:
   ![App Architecture](img/argoCD.png)

7. **Understanding the Argo CD Image Updater Behavior**:

   When Argo CD Image Updater updates an application, it creates or updates a specific configuration file within the designated repository to track the updated image version. For example, with the setup you've defined:

   The Image Updater will write a file named `.argocd-source-aws-ec2-instance-checker.yaml` in the `helm` directory of your repository. This file will look something like:

   ```yaml
   helm:
     parameters:
     - name: image.name
       value: fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker
       forcestring: true
     - name: image.tag
       value: 6.0.0
       forcestring: true
   ```

   This file is instrumental for Argo CD to understand which image and tag should be deployed for the specified application. It's crucial to ensure that this file is either included in the repository (for tracking) or excluded based on your CI/CD preferences.

### Setting up GitHub Actions

Setting up GitHub Actions requires a few setup steps. The following guide provides a basic overview of integrating Docker with GitHub Actions for an example repository:

1. **Docker Credentials with GitHub Actions**:

   Before setting up the GitHub Action workflow, you need to securely provide your Docker credentials to GitHub Actions. Follow the steps below:

   - **Navigate to your GitHub repository**.
   - Open the repository **Settings**.
   - Navigate to **Secrets and variables > Actions**.
   - Click on **New repository secret**.
   - Create a new secret named **DOCKERHUB_USERNAME** and set its value to your Docker ID.
   - Create a new Personal Access Token (PAT) for Docker Hub.
   - Add this PAT as another secret in your GitHub repository with the name **DOCKERHUB_TOKEN**.

   [Further Reading on Docker Credentials in GitHub Actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/)

2. **GitHub Action Workflow Setup**:

   To set up a GitHub Action to build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub whenever there's a push to the master branch, follow these steps:

   - **Navigate to your GitHub repository**.
   - Go to the **Actions** tab.
   - Click on **New Workflow** and choose a template, or set up your custom workflow. Below is an example `.yml` file for the described action:

   ```yaml
   name: Build and Push Docker Image

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ master ]
       paths:
       - 'aws-ec2-instance-checker/**'

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Check Out Code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Log in to DockerHub
         uses: docker/login-action@v1
         with:
           username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
           password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

       - name: Build and Push Docker Image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
         with:
           context: aws-ec2-instance-checker
           push: true
           tags: |
             fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker:${{ github.run_number }}.0.0
             fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker:latest
   ```

3. **Commit and Push Your Workflow**:

   After configuring your workflow, commit and push it to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically recognize the `.yml` file and start the defined workflow whenever the triggering event occurs (in this case, a push to the master branch affecting the `aws-ec2-instance-checker` directory).

---

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This setup enables automatic Docker image builds and pushes using GitHub Actions, leveraging the power of CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment tasks.
