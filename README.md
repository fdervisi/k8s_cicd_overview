# GitOps in Action: Mastering CI/CD with Microservice-Based Applications

In the dynamic world of DevOps, integrating cloud resources with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is more than just a trendâ€”it's a significant shift. With this guide, I aim to provide a deep dive into this evolution, spotlighting the Flask-powered AWS EC2 Instance Checker as our illustrative microservice application. This tool is structured as a two-tier web application. Crucially, it employs an [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) (Open Policy Agent) server, a general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack. With the OPA server, the application can conduct a range of validations against AWS resources, ensuring that operations align with predefined policies and best practices.

Central to this journey is a straightforward end-to-end pipeline I've designed. For the Continuous Integration (CI) phase, it actively scans the code for vulnerabilities, build a Docker image, and then uploads it to the repository. Following this, the Continuous Deployment (CD) phase takes over: ArgoCD monitors the Kubernetes deployment, and if any configuration or image changes are detected, it seamlessly deploys the updates to the cluster.

While the AWS EC2 Instance Checker application offers hands-on insights, my primary goal is to shine a light on modern DevOps tools and practices. Adopting a "Learn by Doing" approach, I delve into microservice architectures, CI/CD mechanics, GitOps, and the art of effective pipeline construction.

If you're an architect keen on understanding the nuances of the current DevOps landscape, or an engineer eager to develop robust pipelines, this guide is tailored just for you.

### Setting up ArgoCD Image Updater

For an in-depth guide, you can turn to ArgoCD's Image Updater official documentation [here](https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

1. **Install ArgoCD Image Updater**:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/stable/manifests/install.yaml
    ```

2. **Set Logging Level for Diagnostics**:
   
   Modify the `argocd-image-updater-config` ConfigMap for your desired log level:
   ```yaml
   data:
     log.level: debug
   ```

3. **Verify the Operation**:
   
   Check the logs to ensure the Image Updater is running as expected:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n argocd logs argocd-image-updater-<POD_NAME>
   ```

4. **Authorize Image Updater for GitHub**:

   Store your GitHub credentials as environment variables. Create tokens in GitHub by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens):
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_USER=<YOUR_USERNAME>
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
   ```

   Create the necessary Kubernetes secret:
   ```bash
   kubectl --namespace argocd create secret generic git-creds --from-literal=username=$GITHUB_USER --from-literal=password=$GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

5. **Define an Application with a Manifest**:
   
   Create the ArgoCD application using the Image Updater and the stored GitHub credentials:
   ```yaml
      apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Application
      metadata:
        name: aws-ec2-instance-checker
        namespace: argocd
        annotations:
          argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list: fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker:*
          argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/write-back-method: git:secret:argocd/git-creds
          argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/git-branch: master
      spec:
        project: default
        source:
          repoURL: https://github.com/fdervisi/k8s_cicd_overview
          targetRevision: HEAD
          path: helm/aws-ec2-instance-checker
        destination:
          server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          namespace: aws-ec2-instance-checker
        syncPolicy:
          automated:
            prune: true
            selfHeal: true
            allowEmpty: true
   ```
   - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list`: This annotation specifies the Docker images that the ArgoCD Image Updater should monitor. In this case, it's set to watch for any new versions of the `fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker` image.
   
   - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/write-back-method`: This determines how the Image Updater writes back the updated image version. Here, it's configured to use the stored secret `argocd/git-creds` to directly update the image version in the Git repository.
   
   - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/git-branch`: This directs the Image Updater to target the `master` branch when pushing updates to the Git repository.

   After saving the manifest, apply it to Kubernetes:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f argocd-app.yaml
   ```

   This command will instruct Kubernetes to create the resources defined in the `argocd-app.yaml` file. If the Application already exists, it will be updated with the new specifications from the file.

6. **Validate Configuration**:
   
   Check the Image Updater logs after setting up the application:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n argocd logs argocd-image-updater-<POD_NAME>
   ```

   After setting up an application, you should see logs indicating that the Image Updater is processing an application:

   ```bash
   time="2023-08-15T08:06:06Z" level=info msg="Processing results: applications=1 images_considered=1 images_skipped=0 images_updated=1 errors=0"
   ```

   Verify the application in ArgoCD:
   ```bash
   argocd app list
   ```

   The new application should now be visible in the ArgoCD GUI:
   ![App in ArgoCD](img/argoCD.png)

7. **Understand Argo CD Image Updater Behavior**:

   The Image Updater modifies a specific configuration file within the repository to track updated image versions. For instance, it might produce a `.argocd-source-aws-ec2-instance-checker.yaml` file in your repository's `helm` directory. This file is crucial for Argo CD to discern which image and tag to deploy. It's vital to either include this file in the repository or exclude it, depending on your CI/CD strategy.

   ```yaml
   helm:
     parameters:
     - name: image.name
       value: fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker
       forcestring: true
     - name: image.tag
       value: 6.0.0
       forcestring: true
   ```

### Setting up GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions offers a flexible platform for automating software workflows. Here, we'll guide you through integrating Docker with GitHub Actions for an example project.

1. **Provide Docker Credentials to GitHub Actions**:

   To securely use Docker with GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

   - Go to your **GitHub repository**.
   - Access the repository **Settings**.
   - Head to **Secrets and variables > Actions**.
   - Select **New repository secret**.
   - Create a secret named **DOCKERHUB_USERNAME** with your Docker ID.
   - Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) for Docker Hub.
   - Add this PAT as another secret named **DOCKERHUB_TOKEN**.

   [More on Docker Credentials in GitHub Actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/)

2. **Define GitHub Action Workflow**:

   Create a workflow to build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub upon any change to the master branch:

   - Go to your **GitHub repository**.
   - Click on the **Actions** tab.
   - Choose **New Workflow** or define a custom one.

   Below is a breakdown of a sample [GitHubAction](.github/workflows/docker-image.yaml) configuration:



   **Trigger Events**:

   The workflow is triggered whenever there's a push to the `master` branch and specifically when changes are made to files within the `aws-ec2-instance-checker` directory.

   ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
        paths:
        - 'aws-ec2-instance-checker/**'
   ```

   **Environment**:

   The actions in this workflow will run on the latest version of Ubuntu available on GitHub Actions.

   ```yaml
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   ```

   **Workflow Steps**:

   1. **Check Out Code**:
   
      This step checks out the repository's code to the runner, making it available for subsequent steps in the workflow.

   ```yaml
   - name: Check Out Code
     uses: actions/checkout@v2
   ```

   2. **Set up Python**:
   
      Establishes a Python environment on the runner, specifically using Python version `3.10`. This version can be adjusted based on the project's needs.

   ```yaml
   - name: Set up Python
     uses: actions/setup-python@v2
     with:
       python-version: '3.10'
   ```

   3. **Install Dependencies**:
   
      Upgrades `pip` to its latest version and then installs the `bandit` tool, a Python security linter.

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Dependencies
     run: |
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       pip install bandit
   ```

   4. **Run Bandit**:
   
      Executes Bandit to scan the code in the `aws-ec2-instance-checker` directory for potential security vulnerabilities. The attribute `continue-on-error: true` ensures that even if Bandit flags issues, the workflow doesn't halt and continues to the next steps.

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Bandit
     run: bandit -r aws-ec2-instance-checker
     continue-on-error: true
   ```

   5. **Log in to DockerHub**:
   
      Uses stored secrets to securely log into DockerHub. This is vital to push the Docker image subsequently.

   ```yaml
   - name: Log in to DockerHub
     uses: docker/login-action@v1
     with:
       username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
       password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

   6. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
   
      Constructs a Docker image from the code within the `aws-ec2-instance-checker` directory and then pushes this image to DockerHub. The image receives two tags: one based on the current GitHub Actions run number and another as the `latest` version.

   ```yaml
   - name: Build and Push Docker Image
     uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
     with:
       context: aws-ec2-instance-checker
       push: true
       tags: |
         fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker:${{ github.run_number }}.0.0
         fdervisi/aws-ec2-instance-checker:latest
   ```

   7. **Monitoring the CI Process via GitHub Actions**

   Once you've initiated the CI/CD process, you can actively monitor its progress. Begin by logging into your GitHub account. Navigate to the repository in question and click on the "Actions" tab. This section provides a visual representation of the CI process, detailing each step and its status.

   ![GitHub Action Workflow](img/github-action.png)

   8. **Verifying the Docker Image Update**

   After the CI process completes, the pipeline proceeds to build and update the Docker image based on the changes made. This update can be verified by visiting Docker Hub. There, you'll observe that the recent build has been pushed, reflecting the modifications made in the CI process. 

   ![Updated Image on Docker Hub](img/docker-hub.png)

3. **Activate Your Workflow**:

   Commit and push your workflow. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the `.yaml` file, initiating the workflow upon any qualifying event (e.g., changes to the `aws-ec2-instance-checker` directory on the master branch).

### Automating the Full CI/CD Pipeline

As we journey through the intricacies of CI/CD automation, it's vital to address a specific detail that demands attention to ensure a fully automated pipeline. It underscores the principle that adaptations are often required based on the unique demands of your project.

The OPA policy is encapsulated within a config map:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  check_imdsv1.rego: |
    package ec2

    default match = false

    match {
        input.MetadataOptions.HttpTokens == "optional"
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: opa-policy
```

When developers modify the OPA policy, ArgoCD synchronizes it. However, a challenge arises: the OPA deployment doesn't restart automatically when the content of the config map changes. To address this, I opted for a straightforward yet effective solution:

[Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) is a Kubernetes controller that watches changes in ConfigMap and Secret, then takes the necessary action on pods (like restarting) to make the updated data available. This tool is pivotal in ensuring our deployments are always in sync with our configuration changes.

**Installing Reloader using Vanilla Manifests**:

Instead of using Helm, you can also deploy Reloader using vanilla manifests. Here's how:

1. Replace the `RELEASE-NAME` placeholder provided in the manifest with a proper value.
2. Deploy Reloader by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Reloader/master/deployments/kubernetes/reloader.yaml
```

By default, Reloader is deployed in the default namespace and watches changes in secrets and configmaps across all namespaces.

If needed, Reloader's behavior can be fine-tuned. For instance, it can be configured to ignore certain resources like secrets and configmaps. This is achieved by passing specific arguments (`spec.template.spec.containers.args`) to its container.

Below is the deployment configuration leveraging `reloader`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: opa
  labels:
    app: opa
  annotations:
    configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "opa-policy"
spec:
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.opa.replicaCount }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: opa
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: opa
      name: opa
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: opa
          image: "{{ .Values.opa.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.opa.image.tag }}"
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.opa.image.pullPolicy }}
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: {{ .Values.opa.containerPort }}
          args:
            - "run"
            - "--ignore=.*"  # exclude hidden dirs created by Kubernetes
            - "--server"
            - "/policies"
          volumeMounts:
            - readOnly: true
              mountPath: /policies
              name: check-imdsv1-policy
      volumes:
        - name: check-imdsv1-policy
          configMap:
            name: opa-policy
```

`configmap.reloader.stakater.com/reload: "opa-policy"`

This annotation is specific to **reloader**. It indicates to the `reloader` that it should watch the specified ConfigMap (`opa-policy` in this case). When changes occur in the `opa-policy` ConfigMap, `reloader` will automatically trigger a rolling restart of the pods that are using this ConfigMap. This ensures that the latest configuration changes are picked up by the associated pods without manual intervention, facilitating seamless and dynamic updates in a Kubernetes environment.
